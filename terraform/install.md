Certainly! Here are the step-by-step instructions with links included:

Step 1: Download Terraform Binary
Open your web browser and navigate to the Terraform Downloads page.

Scroll down to the "Terraform" section and locate the Linux binary for your architecture (most likely linux_amd64). It should be listed under the "Other Platforms" section.

Right-click on the download link for the Linux binary and select "Copy link address" to copy the download link to your clipboard.

Step 2: Download Terraform Binary
Open a terminal window on your Linux system.

Change to the directory where you want to download the Terraform binary.

```
cd ~/Downloads
```
Use the wget command followed by the copied download link to download the Terraform binary.
```
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.4.6/terraform_1.4.6_linux_amd64.zip
```
Replace https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.4.6/terraform_1.4.6_linux_amd64.zip with the actual download link you copied in Step 3.

Step 3: Extract the Binary
Once the download is complete, use the unzip command to extract the Terraform binary from the downloaded zip file.
```
unzip terraform_*.zip
```
Step 4: Move the Binary to a Directory in PATH
Move the extracted terraform binary to a directory that is included in your system's PATH, such as /usr/local/bin/. This ensures that you can run Terraform commands from any directory.
```
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
```
or 
```
sudo mv snap /usr/local/bin/
```
Step 5: Verify the Installation
Verify that Terraform is installed correctly by checking its version.
```
terraform --version
```
You should see output similar to this:

```
Terraform v1.4.6
```
